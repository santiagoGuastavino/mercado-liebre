[Mercado Liebre](https://mercado-liebre-smg.herokuapp.com/):
---
- This project is a mock-up of a well known argentine e-trading website: [Mercado Libre](https://www.mercadolibre.com.ar/).  
- It was achieved by following steps provided by the [Coding Academy](https://www.digitalhouse.com/) I'm being tutored by.  
- It has no functionality as of yet.  
- I had a lot of fun writing it's code and I'm proud of the results.  
- I think I might like front end a bit too much.  
- I'm looking forward to make it operative with some back end.
